#  How to Play Songs Bingo in Madagascar

In the western world, bingo is often seen as a game enjoyed by retirees in churches and Elks Lodges. However, in Madagascar it is a popular form of entertainment among all ages. There are numerous ways to play bingo, but the following is one of the most popular versions in Madagascar.

To play, each player needs a sheet of paper with three columns and nine rows. In the first column, players write the numbers one through nine. In the second column, they write down all of the songs that they know. In the third column, they write down any words or phrases that could be called out during the game.

The game starts with one player calling out a number from one to nine. The player whose row contains that number then crosses it off their list. If someone has already crossed off that number on their list, they cannot cross it off again.

The next player then calls out another number from one to nine and play continues in this way until somebody wins by crossing off all of the numbers on their list.

As an added twist, players can also call out any words or phrases from column three instead of numbers. These could be things like “BINGO”, “DOG” or “CAT”. When a player hears their word or phrase called out, they cross it off their list just like if it was a number.

This game is a lot of fun and can be played with any number of players. It’s perfect for gatherings with friends or family and helps to pass the time while enjoying some music!

#  Find New Music from the Movie Madagascar

If you're a fan of the movie Madagascar, and you love finding new music to listen to, look no further. This article is for you! I'll provide a few suggestions for bands and artists you can check out, based on the music featured in the film.

First up is Danny Jacobs, who sings "I Like to Move It." Jacobs has a unique sound, blending reggae and pop together. If you're looking for an upbeat song to get you moving, Danny Jacobs is a great option.

Another artist featured in Madagascar is Dashboard Confessional. They perform the song "Screaming Infidelities," which is a slower ballad. If you're in the mood for something more mellow, Dashboard Confessional is a great choice.

Finally, I recommend The Hives. They play "Walk Idiot Walk" in the movie, and it's an energetic song that's perfect for getting pumped up. The Hives are sure to get your adrenaline going with their high-energy punk rock sound.

#  Get into the Music of Madagascar

Although the island of Madagascar is about the size of France, it is one of the most culturally and musically diverse places on Earth. The music of Madagascar is characterized by its complex syncopated rhythms, polyphonic singing, and use of idiophones (instruments made from natural materials such as gourds, bamboo, or metal).

The most popular form of music in Madagascar is called "rezeda" (pronounced ray-zay-dah). A rezeda band typically consists of a lead singer, two back-up singers, a violinist, a drummer, and a gourd rattle player. Each musician plays an important role in creating the rich textures and harmonies that are characteristic of Malagasy music.

One of the best ways to get into the music of Madagascar is to attend a traditional rezeda concert. These concerts usually take place outdoors under a large tree or at a public square in town. The audience sits on mats on the ground while the musicians perform around them. If you're lucky, you might be able to join in with some dance moves during the intermission!

If you're not able to make it to Madagascar, there are several albums available that will give you a taste of this unique music. One album that I recommend is "Madagascar: Traditional Music from the Island" which was produced by Putumayo World Music. This album features some of the most popular songs from across Madagascar, including "Vakodrazaka," "Tsapiky," and "Tromba."
