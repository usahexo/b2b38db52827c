#  Rangers Cruise to Victory Behind Strong pitching from Darvish and Holland

The Texas Rangers cruised to a 5-1 victory over the Seattle Mariners behind strong pitching performances from Yu Darvish and Derek Holland. Darvish pitched seven innings, allowing just one run on four hits while striking out six. Holland pitched eight innings of one-run ball, striking out six and walking none. Ian Desmond went 2-for-4 with a home run and two RBIs, while Elvis Andrus went 3-for-4 with an RBI to lead the Rangersâ€™ offense.

The Rangers got on the board in the first inning when Ian Desmond hit a solo home run off of Mariners starter Hisashi Iwakuma. They added to their lead in the fourth inning when Elvis Andrus doubled and scored on a single by Rougned Odor. The Rangers increased their lead to 3-0 in the sixth inning when Nomar Mazara singled in Adrian Beltre. The Mariners finally got on the board in the seventh inning when Kyle Seager hit a solo home run off of Darvish. The Rangers added two more runs in the eighth inning when Jonathan Lucroy singled in Adrian Beltre and Elvis Andrus scored on a wild pitch.

The Mariners starter, Hisashi Iwakuma, was charged with four runs on eight hits over six innings. He struck out six and walked one. Reliever Dan Altavilla was charged with an unearned run over 1 2/3 innings. Edwin Diaz allowed two runs in 1/3 of an inning in his first blown save opportunity of the season.

The Rangers will look to complete the sweep of the Mariners on Sunday afternoon behind left-hander Martin Perez. The Mariners will send right-hander Yovani Gallardo to the mound for Game 3

#  Rangers Fall to Blue Jays in Slugfest, Lose Ground in AL East

TORONTO, ON - The Texas Rangers traveled up to Toronto to take on the Blue Jays in a crucial three-game series. Unfortunately for the Rangers, they came out on the losing end of a slugfest, dropping two of three games and falling out of first place in the AL East.

Monday's game was low-scoring throughout, with neither team scoring until the bottom of the seventh inning. That's when things opened up, with both teams scoring four runs in the inning. The Rangers were able to tie things up at 8-8 in the top of the ninth inning, but the Blue Jays pulled ahead in the bottom half and won 10-8.

Tuesday's game was much more high-scoring, with both teams scoring six runs in the first inning alone. The Rangers were again able to tie things up in the top of the ninth inning, but reliever Jason Grilli allowed a walk-off home run to Edwin Encarnacion to lose 6-5.

On Wednesday, it was all Blue Jays. They scored six runs in the first two innings and never looked back, winning 11-3 and taking two games from the Rangers in the process.

The series loss drops Texas out of first place in the AL East for now, as they now sit one game behind Boston heading into their four-game series against them this weekend.

#  Adrian Beltre 3 for 4 with 2 Home Runs as Rangers Blast Twins

Adrian Beltre hit two home runs and drove in four runs as the Texas Rangers cruised to a 10-1 victory over the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday night.

Shin-Soo Choo also went deep for the Rangers, who have won five of their last six games.

Cole Hamels (5-6) allowed one run on four hits over six innings to pick up the win. He struck out eight and walked one.

Beltre's first blast came in the third inning and gave the Rangers a 3-0 lead. His second homer, a solo shot, came in the fifth.

Eddie Rosario had an RBI single for the Twins. Ervin Santana (5-7) was tagged for six runs on seven hits over 4 2/3 innings in losing his third straight start.

#  Yu Darvish looking like an Ace Again silencing Orioles bats



Yu Darvish had a dominant 2017 season with the Dodgers and was one of the primary reasons they reached the World Series. Heading into the 2018 season, there were high expectations for him to continue his dominance. 

He has done just that in his first two starts of the season. In his first outing against the San Francisco Giants, he went six innings, gave up one run on three hits while striking out nine. His second outing was against the Baltimore Orioles where he went seven innings, gave up two runs on four hits while striking out 11. This is particularly impressive given that the Orioles have one of the most potent lineups in baseball. 

Darvish is looking like an ace again and should be a major factor in the Dodgers contending for another World Series title.

#  Josh Hamilton Homers Twice as Texas Slugs Past Angels

In a matchup of two of the top teams in the American League, Josh Hamilton stole the show. The slugger homered twice and drove in four runs as Texas beat Los Angeles 8-3 on Tuesday night.

Hamilton's homers came in consecutive at-bats against starter Garrett Richards in the second and third innings. It was his ninth career multi-homer game and first since hitting three homers against Baltimore last Sept. 5.

"I've been feeling good lately," Hamilton said. "My swing is getting there. I'm just trying to put good swings on the ball."

Hamilton is now batting .323 with six homers and 18 RBIs this season. He has also reached base safely in all but one of his 18 games this year.

The Rangers (15-3) have now won eight consecutive games and own the best record in baseball. Los Angeles (13-7) had its five-game winning streak come to an end.
