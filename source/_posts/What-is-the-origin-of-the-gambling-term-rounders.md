#  What is the origin of the gambling term rounders?

Rounders is a card game that is believed to have originated in England in the early 18th century. It is a variant of the game of whist, and became very popular in the United States in the late 19th century. The game can be played by two or more players, and usually involves betting on the outcome of each hand.

The exact origin of the term rounders is unknown, but it is thought to date back to the early days of the game. One possible explanation is that it was derived from an old English word meaning "to go around", which was used to describe the movement of players around the table. Another possibility is that it was named after a player named Rounder George, who was reputed to be one of the best players in England.

#  What are some examples of the gambling term rounders?

Rounders is a term used in gambling to describe a situation where a player is not sure whether to call or fold. For example, if a player has a pair of eights and there is another player with a king showing, the player might consider calling because they have a good chance of winning the hand.

In the game of poker, a rounder is a player who regularly plays in low-stakes cash games. This term is most often used in the United States, where low-stakes poker games are much more popular than in other countries. The average buy-in for a rounder’s game is typically around $10 or $20.

If you want to start playing poker but don’t want to invest too much money, then you should look for games with a rounder. This will give you the opportunity to learn the game and make some mistakes without risking too much money.

Of course, if you’re looking to make some serious money playing poker, you shouldn’t focus exclusively on rounders’ games. But they can be a good way to build up your skills and bankroll before moving up to higher stakes.
