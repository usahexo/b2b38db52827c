#  How to Win at Blackjack Gold 1

First, it’s important to understand the game of blackjack and the different types of bets that are available.

There are six basic bets in blackjack: 
-Standard Bet: This is a bet made on whether the player or the dealer will have the highest score after two cards are dealt. 
-Pass Line Bet: This is a bet made at the beginning of a hand that the player will win. 
-Come Bet: This is a follow up to a Pass Line Bet and becomes a win if the original bet wins and a loss if it doesn’t. 
-Don't Pass Line Bet: This is the opposite of the Pass Line Bet and wins if the player loses and vice versa. 
-Place Bets: These are side bets that can be placed on different outcomes, such as whether both cards will be of one suit or whether the first card dealt will be an Ace. 
-Pair Plus: This is a bet made on whether the player will receive a pair or better with their first two cards.

Knowing these different bets is key to winning at blackjack gold. The first step is to make sure you always make standard bets and never place bets, as these offer lower payouts and increase your risk of losing money. Next, learn which combinations of cards give you the best odds of winning. The best hand to have in blackjack gold is two Aces, followed by three matching cards of any value (e.g., three Kings). If you don't have any of these combinations, try to get close as possible - for example, two Kings and an Ace would beat two Queens and a Two. As long as you stick to these basic rules, you should be able to win consistently at blackjack gold!

#  Tips for Winning at Blackjack Gold 1

Blackjack Gold is an exciting online blackjack game that offers players the chance to win big payouts. If you’re looking to up your game and improve your chances of winning, follow these tips:

Tip #1: familiarize yourself with the game

The first step to playing Blackjack Gold successfully is to become familiar with the rules and features of the game. This means understanding the different card values, the options available for placing bets and the payout rates. Once you understand how to play, you can begin formulate a strategy.

Tip #2: Start with a small bet

When you’re starting out, it’s best to start with a small bet and increase it as you gain experience. This will help you stay in control while also allowing you to make some modest profits.

Tip #3: Use basic strategy

One of the most important tips for playing Blackjack Gold is to use basic strategy. This involves making moves based on the odds and gives you the best chance of winning. You can find detailed guides online which will show you how to employ basic strategy for each possible scenario.

Tip #4: Know when to hit and when to stand

A big part of basic strategy is knowing when to hit and when to stand. Hitting means asking for another card, while standing means sticking with what you have. You need to make these decisions based on your hand total and the dealer’s face-up card. For example, if you have a total of 16 and the dealer has a 3, you should hit as your chances of winning are better than if you stand.

Tip #5: Don’t forget about doubling down!

Doubling down is another important move that can help improve your chances of winning. This involves doubling your bet after seeing your initial two cards and then receiving just one more card from the dealer. So, for example, if you have an ace and a six, instead of just hitting (asking for another card), you could double down which would involve betting twice as much as your original bet. If then ace comes up again, you would receive 10 points (one point for each ace plus the six).

Aces are worth 1 or 11 points, 2 through 10 are worth their face value, and any king, queen or jack is worth 10 points.
