Black Bear Casino Resort is only a short drive away from Duluth, Minnesota. Duluth is a city with a population of over 86,000 people and it is located on the shores of Lake Superior. Duluth is also home to the Aerial Lift Bridge which spans the Saint Louis River. The Aerial Lift Bridge was built in 1905 and it is 605 feet long. It was the first bridge in the United States to be built with an aerial lift span. The bridge has been featured in movies such as Jaws 2, Grumpy Old Men, and Drop Dead Fred. 

In addition to the Aerial Lift Bridge, Duluth is also home to the Glensheen Mansion. The Glensheen Mansion was built in 1908 for Chester Congdon and his wife Clara. The mansion is a 39 room Jacobean Revival style house that is now open to the public as a museum. The mansion was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and it is also a Minnesota State Historic Site.
