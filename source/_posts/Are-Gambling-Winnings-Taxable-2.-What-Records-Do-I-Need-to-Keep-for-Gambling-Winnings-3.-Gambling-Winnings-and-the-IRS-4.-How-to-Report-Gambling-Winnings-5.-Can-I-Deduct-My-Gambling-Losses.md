Are gambling winnings taxable?

Gambling winnings are considered taxable income by the IRS. This means that you must report all gambling winnings on your tax return and pay taxes on them.

What records do I need to keep for gambling winnings?

You should keep track of all your gambling winnings and losses so that you can accurately report them to the IRS. You should maintain records of the following:
Currency amount gambled 
Date of the gamble 
Location where the gamble took place 
Name of the game or gambling activity 
Winning or losing streak information 
Prize won (if any) 
Any other relevant information, such as cancelled tickets or receipts for purchased chips


Gambling Winnings and the IRS
The IRS requires you to report all of your gambling winnings on your tax return. This includes cash, prizes, tips, and any other type of taxable income from gambling. Gambling losses may be deducted from your taxable income, but only up to the amount of your total gambling winnings. So, if you have $1,000 in gambling winnings and $2,000 in losses, you can only deduct $1,000 worth of losses from your taxes.
How to Report Gambling Winnings

To report your gambling income on your tax return, you will need to complete Schedule C (Profit or Loss From Business). This form is used to report self-employed income and expenses. On line 21 of Schedule C, you will list your gross gambling income. Then, on line 28, you will subtract your allowable gambling losses to arrive at your net gambling income. The resulting number will go on line 31 of Schedule C as Other Income. Below is an example:

Your Schedule C:

Line 21: Gross Gambling Income - $3,000
Line 28: Gambling Losses - ($1,500) 
Net Gambling Income = $1,500  
Other Income = $1,500

Can I Deduct My Gambling Losses?

You can deduct your allowable gambling losses from your taxable income when filing your taxes. However, you can only deduct up to the amount of your total gambling winnings. So, if you have $1,000 in taxable income from gambling and $2,000 in losses, you can only deduct $1,000 worth of losses on your taxes.
