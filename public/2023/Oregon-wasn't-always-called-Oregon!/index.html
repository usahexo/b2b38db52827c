        <h1 id="Oregon-wasn’t-always-called-Oregon"><a href="#Oregon-wasn’t-always-called-Oregon" class="headerlink" title="Oregon wasn’t always called Oregon!"></a>Oregon wasn’t always called Oregon!</h1><p>Oregon was a name given to the Oregon Territory by the United States in 1848. The Oregon Territory at that time consisted of modern-day Oregon, Washington and Idaho. Before that, the area was known as the Columbia District after the Columbia River. </p>
<p>The first known European in the area was Gray Eyes, a Native American who accompanied fur traders on their explorations of the region in 1810-1811. Other notable European explorers of the region include Lewis and Clark, who passed through what is now Oregon on their epic journey across America in 1805-1806. </p>
<p>The Oregon Territory was originally claimed by both Britain and America, as both countries had overlapping claims to various parts of North America. The Oregon Treaty of 1846 finally settled the dispute, with Britain ceding its claim to Oregon in exchange for money owed to British merchants from American merchants.</p>
<h1 id="What-do-you-call-a-game-of-bingo-in-Oregon"><a href="#What-do-you-call-a-game-of-bingo-in-Oregon" class="headerlink" title="What do you call a game of bingo in Oregon?"></a>What do you call a game of bingo in Oregon?</h1><p>Oregonians, like residents of other states, enjoy playing bingo. But what do you call a game of bingo in Oregon? The answer may depend on where you are in the state.</p>
<p>If you’re in the eastern part of Oregon, chances are you would call a game of bingo a “bingo.” However, if you’re in the western part of the state, you may call it a “ housie .”</p>
<p>Both terms are used throughout Oregon, and both are derived from the traditional game of bingo. So how did these two terms come to be used in Oregon?</p>
<p>The answer lies in Oregon’s history. In the early 1900s, when bingo was first introduced to the state, there were already two popular games of chance being played – “keno” and “housie.” And because each area of the state had its own preferred term for these games, it wasn’t long before “bingo” and “housie” started being used interchangeably.</p>
<p>Today, both terms are still used in Oregon, with “bingo” being more popular in the eastern part of the state and “housie” being more popular in the western part. But either term can be used statewide to describe a game of bingo.</p>
<h1 id="How-did-Oregon-get-its-name"><a href="#How-did-Oregon-get-its-name" class="headerlink" title="How did Oregon get its name?"></a>How did Oregon get its name?</h1><p>Oregon was given its name by Captain John Charles Frémont of the United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers, who named it in 1845 for the Oregon Territory, which in turn had been named for the Columbia River, named after English naval officer Henry Middleton who was captain of HMS Romney when it explored the region in 1792.</p>
<p>The origin of the name has been disputed. One theory is that it was named for the river, which in turn was named for the English naval officer. However, French Canadian fur traders had been calling the river Rivière des Oreilles (“river of the ears”) since 1729 because they found Big Bend—a sharp turn in the Columbia near The Dalles—resembling a human ear. Another theory is that it was named by Frémont himself, after his home state of Missouri.</p>
<h1 id="What-was-Oregon’s-original-name"><a href="#What-was-Oregon’s-original-name" class="headerlink" title="What was Oregon’s original name?"></a>What was Oregon’s original name?</h1><p>Oregon’s original name was actually “Columbia.” This name was given to the territory by the British, who claimed control over the region in the 1700s. The name Oregon was only formally adopted in 1848, when it became a U.S. territory.</p>
<h1 id="Bingo-was-once-known-as-Oregon"><a href="#Bingo-was-once-known-as-Oregon" class="headerlink" title="Bingo was once known as Oregon"></a>Bingo was once known as Oregon</h1><p>Bingo is a game that has been around for centuries and has many different variations. The game was once known as Oregon, but the name was changed to bingo in the early 1900s. The exact origin of the game is unknown, but it is believed to have originated in Italy or France.</p>
